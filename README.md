# PocketcampGuideCli

Welcome to the PocketCamp guide gem! This is a CLI application allowing PocketCamp users (campers) to find information about the animals characters in the game. You can either look for information about an animal by typing its name, or search by the resource's name you are looking for. The CLI application will print a list of animals responding to these criterias.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pocketcamp_guide_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pocketcamp_guide_cli

## Usage

Run with 
    ruby bin/pocketcamp-guide
Type the above and follow the on screen prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
